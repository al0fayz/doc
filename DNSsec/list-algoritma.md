# list algoritma

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a suite of extensions to DNS that adds an additional layer of security to the domain name system. To provide a list of algorithms used in DNSSEC, I can list algorithms from 1 to 13 as of my last knowledge update in September 2021. Keep in mind that the DNSSEC algorithm numbers may evolve over time, so it's essential to check the latest specifications and updates for the most current information. Here are DNSSEC algorithms 1 through 13 as of my last update:

1. RSA/MD5 (deprecated): This algorithm was deprecated due to security vulnerabilities and should not be used.

2. Diffie-Hellman: This algorithm is also deprecated and should not be used.

3. DSA/SHA-1 (deprecated): DSA with SHA-1 was deprecated due to concerns about the security of SHA-1.

4. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with SHA-256: This is a widely used and recommended algorithm for DNSSEC.

5. RSA/SHA-1 (deprecated): RSA with SHA-1 was deprecated due to concerns about the security of SHA-1.

6. Diffie-Hellman (deprecated): This is another deprecated Diffie-Hellman algorithm.

7. DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 (deprecated): DSA with NSEC3 and SHA-1 was deprecated due to concerns about the security of SHA-1.

8. RSASHA256: RSA with SHA-256 is recommended for DNSSEC.

9. RSASHA512: RSA with SHA-512 is recommended for DNSSEC.

10. ECC-GOST: This is a GOST elliptic curve algorithm, and its usage may vary depending on local regulations and policies.

11. ECDSAP256SHA256: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with P-256 curve and SHA-256.

12. ECDSAP384SHA384: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with P-384 curve and SHA-384.

13. Ed25519: Ed25519 is an elliptic curve signature algorithm that offers strong security and performance. It is becoming increasingly popular for DNSSEC.

Please note that the DNSSEC landscape may have evolved since my last knowledge update in September 2021, so it's crucial to consult the latest DNSSEC specifications and best practices to ensure the use of the most secure algorithms. Additionally, specific DNSSEC algorithm support may vary among DNS resolver and DNS hosting providers.
